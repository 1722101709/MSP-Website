            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <span>C is a mid-level and procedural programming language. The Procedural programming language
                is also known as the structured programming language is a technique in which large programs are
                broken down into smaller modules.

                <ul>
                    <li>C functions are used to avoid the rewriting the same code again and again in our program.</li>
                    <li>C functions can be called any number of times from any place of our program.</li>

            <div class="answer">
                <span>C  is known as a mother language because most of the compilers and JVMs are written in C
                language.

            <div class="answer">
                <span>C is called a mid-level programming language because it binds the low level and high -level
                programming language.
