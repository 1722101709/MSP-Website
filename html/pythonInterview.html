                          String literals are formed by enclosing text in the single or double quotes. For example, string
                          literals are string values.

                          Python contains one special literal, that is, <strong>'None'</strong>. This special literal is used for defining a null
                          variable. If 'None' is compared with anything else other than a 'None', it will return false.

                  <span>The Python dictionary is a built-in data type. It defines a one-to-one relationship between keys
                  and values. Dictionaries contain a pair of keys and their corresponding values. It stores elements
