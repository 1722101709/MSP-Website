                <span><strong>Linear Data Structure :</strong> A data structure is called linear if all of its elements

                <span><strong>Non-Linear Data Structure :</strong> The Non-linear data structure does not form a
                sequence i.e. each item or element is connected with two or more other items in
                a non-linear arrangement.</span>

                <span>Define linked list?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <span>A linked list may be defined as a linear data structure which can store a
                collection of items.</span>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Singly Linked List :</strong>The singly linked list includes nodes which contain a data
                    field and next field. The next field further points to the next node in the line of
                    nodes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Doubly Linked List :</strong>Doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists
                    of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Circular Linked List :</strong>Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are
                    connected to form a circle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advantages of a linked list :</strong>The main advantage of a linked list is that we do
                    not need to specify a fixed size for the list. The more elements we add to the
                    chain, the bigger the chain gets</li>
                    <li><strong>Drawbacks of the linked list :</strong>Random access is not allowed. We need to
                    access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot perform
                    a binary search with linked lists.More memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.</li>

                <ul style="font-size : 17px;">
                    <li><strong>Merge sort :</strong> This algorithm works on splitting an array into two halves. Each
                    half is sorted and merge back together by using merge function.
                    <br><br>Time Complexity : O(nlogn)</li>
                    <li><strong>Selection sort :</strong> In this at first smallest element is send to the first position.The
                    next smallest element is searched in the remaining array and is placed in
                    second position.This goes until last element is placed in right position.
                    <br><br>Time Complexity :  O(n^2)</li>
                    <li><strong>Bubble sort :</strong> Simplest of all algorithms. It works on the principle of repeatedly
                    swapping adjacent elements in case they are not in the right order.

                    <li><strong>Quick sort :</strong>It is highly efficient sorting algorithm. It is based on divide and
                    conquer approach.An array is divided into subarrays by selecting a pivot
                    element.It partitions an array and then calls itself recursively to sort the two
                    resulting subarrays.<br><br>Pivot : An element of an array,which is selected first by algorithm.<br><br>Time Complexity : O(nlogn)</li>
