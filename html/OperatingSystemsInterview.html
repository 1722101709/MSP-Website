                <span>It is a program that acts as an Intermediary between the user and the computer
                hardware.</span>
                <span><strong>Purpose :</strong></span>
                <ul>
                    <li>It provide convenient environment in which user can execute programs in
                    efficient manner.</li>
                    <li> It is a resource allocator responsible for allocating system resources.</li>
                    <li> It control program which controls the operation of computer hardware.</li>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <span><strong>Batched operating systems :</strong> The user of batch operating system never directly
                interacts with the computer.</span>
                <span><strong>Time_sharing Operating Systems :</strong> It enables people located at different
                terminal to use a single computer system at the same time.</span>
                <span>
                    <span><strong>Real time OS :</strong> Time interval to process and responds to input is very small.</span>
                    <span>Ex : Space software and military software</span>
                </span>
                <span><strong>Distributed OS :</strong> It uses many processors located in different machines to
                provide very fast computations.</span>
                <span><strong>Multiprogramming OS :</strong> OS keeps several jobs in memory at a time-sharing the
                processor,when two or more programs reside in memory at the same time.</span>
